**PayWave** is a RESTful API designed to process payments, offering complete payment handling functionality with multiple payment gateways. The API was developed using PHP (Symfony framework), integrating Stripe and PayPal for payment processing, Redis for caching, and containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes. The architecture is designed for high performance and scalability, leveraging event-driven processing and a reliable fallback mechanism between gateways.

**Project Objectives:**
- **Complete Payment Handling**: The API allows processing, updating, and managing payments with support for multiple gateways.
- **Multi-Gateway Support**: Integration with Stripe and PayPal to provide multiple options for payment processing, ensuring flexibility and reliability.
- **Scalability and Resilience**: Built using containerized architecture (Docker and Kubernetes) to guarantee scalability and high availability, even under heavy load.
- **Optimized Performance**: Redis is utilized to cache frequent payment data, reducing latency and improving system responsiveness.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: A robust fallback logic ensures that if one payment gateway fails, another gateway can be used to process the payment.

**Technologies Used:**
- **PHP (Symfony Framework)**: Main platform for the API implementation.
- **Stripe and PayPal**: Payment gateways used for processing transactions.
- **Redis**: In-memory caching system used to reduce load on payment gateways and improve performance.
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker used for event-driven architecture, ensuring asynchronous and resilient payment processing.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing the application, allowing easy deployment and scaling.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform to manage scaling and ensure high availability of the payment API.
- **JWT**: Can be used for user authentication and authorization to secure sensitive payment operations.

**Architecture Overview:**
The architecture is designed with scalability and fault-tolerance in mind, ensuring that payments are processed efficiently across multiple gateways. It integrates a fallback mechanism to automatically retry failed transactions using alternate gateways.

**Main Components:**
- **Payment Management**: Includes the logic for processing, updating, and managing payments.
- **Gateway Integration**: Responsible for interfacing with Stripe and PayPal to process transactions.
- **Retry and Fallback Logic**: If a transaction fails with one gateway, the system automatically retries it with an alternative gateway.

**Operation Flow:**

1. **Process a Payment**:
   - Step 1: The client sends a `POST /payments` request with payment details.
   - Step 2: The request is received by `PaymentController`, which triggers the `ProcessPayment` use case.
   - Step 3: The payment is processed by the primary gateway (Stripe or PayPal).
   - Step 4: If the payment fails, the fallback logic switches to the alternate gateway for processing.
   - Step 5: Redis updates the cache with the payment status to optimize subsequent queries.

2. **Get Payment Status**:
   - Step 1: The client sends a `GET /payments/:id` request to check the status of a payment.
   - Step 2: The `PaymentController` retrieves the payment status from the Redis cache.
   - Step 3: If the data is not available in the cache, the payment status is fetched from the database and cached for future requests.

3. **Update a Payment**:
   - Step 1: The client sends a `PUT /payments/:id` request to update payment information.
   - Step 2: The `PaymentController` triggers the `UpdatePayment` use case to modify payment details.
   - Step 3: The updated payment information is propagated to the selected gateway and the Redis cache is invalidated.

4. **Handle Payment Failures**:
   - Step 1: If a payment fails, the system initiates a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.
   - Step 2: After a specified number of retries, the system triggers a fallback to another payment gateway.
   - Step 3: If all retries fail, the payment is marked as failed, and the status is updated in both the cache and the database.

**Configuration and Orchestration:**

- **Docker**: PayWave is containerized using Docker, facilitating development, deployment, and scaling across environments. Docker Compose is used for local development, orchestrating the API and its dependencies like Redis and RabbitMQ.

- **Kubernetes**: In production, Kubernetes manages the PayWave API. It allows automatic scaling based on transaction volume and ensures high availability of the service. Kubernetes configurations include:
  - **Deployment**: Defines the number of API replicas and their distribution within the cluster.
  - **Service**: Provides a stable interface to access the API containers.
  - **Ingress**: Manages external access to the API and routes requests to the appropriate services.

**Proposed Features**:
- **Payment Processing**: Full support for payment processing with multiple gateways (Stripe, PayPal).
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automated retry logic with fallback to alternative payment gateways.
- **Caching**: Redis integration to cache payment statuses and improve response time.
- **Authentication**: Possibility to implement JWT for securing sensitive operations like payment modifications.
- **Scalability**: Designed for horizontal scalability using Kubernetes to handle increased payment volume.

**Next Steps and Future Expansions**:
- **User Management**: Adding user support to track payments and implement payment history features.
- **Fraud Detection**: Integrating fraud detection mechanisms to secure payment transactions.
- **Payment Notifications**: Implementing notification services to alert users of payment statuses.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Adding monitoring tools like Prometheus and logging services such as ELK Stack to enhance system observability.

PayWave is built to be a robust, scalable, and efficient payment processing solution, designed to handle high volumes of transactions across multiple gateways. The architecture focuses on scalability and fault tolerance, ensuring that payments are processed smoothly, even in failure scenarios, while maintaining high performance with Redis caching and Kubernetes orchestration.
